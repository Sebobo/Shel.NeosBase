⚠️ **NOTE**

This package is not being further developed anymore as most features have been replaced over the years with Neos core functionality.
You can still copy parts you might need, but it's not recommended to be installed anymore.


## Description

This package works as starting point for Neos CMS projects.
It provides good defaults needed in many projects and can be combined
with other packages to quickly setup a new website.

## Features

### NodeTypes

#### MetaMenuMixin 

`Shel.NeosBase:MetaMenuMixin` can be added as super type 
to `Neos.Neos:Document` to mark pages to be shown with 
the `Shel.NeosBase:MetaMenu` ts object.
For example in a site footer.

#### RootPage

`Shel.NeosBase:RootPage` is a good starting point for a website which 
can have additional properties for the whole website. 
Change the type of your root node to this to use it.

You should add the following constraint to your document types to
only allow the `RootPage` as site root and adapt it to your nodenames:

```yaml
"My.Package:MyDocumentType":
 constraints:
  nodeTypes:
   "Shel.NeosBase:RootPage": false
```

### Form elements

* `Shel.NeosBase:Honeypot` is a hidden form element which catches spam bots.

### Viewhelpers

* `EmbedViewHelper` allows to embed file content via fluid, for example svg files.
* `FlattenViewHelper` renders an two-dimensional array as simple string for sending form data via mail.   
* `TagViewHelper` renders a tag with defined attributes. Instead of writing something like this in your node templates `<div{attributes ->f:format.raw()}>` you can now write `<snb:tag attributes="{attributes}" tag="div">`    

To use them, add the following to your fluid template:

```fluid
{namespace snb=Shel\NeosBase\ViewHelpers}  
```    
Or when you want autocompletion add instead the following to the 
beginning of your template:

```xml
<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" lang="en"
      xmlns:snb="https://xsd.helzle.it/ns/Shel/NeosBase/ViewHelpers">
```          
Afterwards alt-click on the schema url and tell PhpStorm to fetch the schema from the external resource. 
    
#### Fluid viewhelper schemas 

For autocompletion you can add the viewhelper schema to PhpStorm.
The schema is in the package folder at `Documentation/Schema.xsd`.

To rebuild the Fluid viewhelper schema for this package run this:

```console
./flow documentation:generatexsd --phpNamespace "Shel\NeosBase\ViewHelpers" --targetFile Packages/Plugins/Shel.NeosBase/Documentation/Schema.xsd --xsdNamespace "https://helzle.it/ns/Shel/NeosBase/ViewHelpers"
```

### Validators

* `IsEmptyValidator` - for the included HoneyPot form element. 

### Enhanced TypoScript for page rendering

#### Page rendering

This package uses the alternative page rendering described in the [Neos documentation](http://neos.readthedocs.org/en/stable/HowTos/SelectingPageTemplate.html#using-a-defaultpage-prototype).
The basic prototype to extend from is `Shel.NeosBase:DefaultPage`. 
Read the Neos documentation about how to add your own page layouts. 
 
#### Additional html head parts 

Adds additional configurable meta tags in the page header (f.e. css, author, ie compatibility, viewport, favicon, etc...). 
See the prototype `Shel.NeosBase:DefaultPage` for details.

#### Additional html body parts

Also included is a configurable live reload script when you are developing your stylesheets. 
See `Settings.yaml` for the configuration.

To easily include your javascript bundle see the ts path `body.javascripts.bundle`.

#### TypoScript objects

* `Shel.NeosBase:Navigation` is a menu to be used for the main site navigation
* `Shel.NeosBase:MetaMenu` is a menu which renders all documents marked with the `Show in meta menu` property, provided by the `Shel.NeosBase:MetaMenuMixin`.
* `Shel.NeosBase:SiteLogo` is a configurable helper to render the site logo including the link to the homepage.
* `Shel.NeosBase:LinkTag`, `Shel.NeosBase:ScriptTag`, `Shel.NeosBase:MetaTag`, `Shel.NeosBase:StyleSheetTag` make it easier to add custom tags to document. 
* `Shel.NeosBase:Debug` is a fusion helper to output a fusion value to the browser console.
